//  Every pose track archived from the phone (`just pull-tracks`) is analyzed as the app would: detect the
//  exercise, count the reps. Each track's exercise and count are pinned in Fixtures/archived-counts.json, so an
//  analyzer change that moves any of them fails here and has to say so (the 2026-09-28 review, #171). The pins
//  are what the analyzers said when pinned, not verified counts: a verified set belongs in `Fixture.all`.
//  After a deliberate change: `ARCHIVED_PIN_WRITE=1 swift test --filter ArchivedTracks`, then name the moved
//  tracks in the exercise's docs/analysis entry.
